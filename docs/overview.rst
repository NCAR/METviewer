Overview of METviewer
=====================


1.1 Purpose and organization of the User's Guide
------------------------------------------------

The goal of this User's Guide is to provide basic information for users of the METViewer database and display system to enable users to create plots from their MET output statistics. 

The METViewer User's Guide is organized as follows.

1.2 The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
------------------------------------------

METViewer has been developed, and will be maintained and enhanced, by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC; http://www.dtcenter.org/ ). The main goal of the DTC is to serve as a bridge between operations and research, to facilitate the activities of these two important components of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) community. The DTC provides an environment that is functionally equivalent to the operational environment in which the research community can test model enhancements; the operational community benefits from DTC testing and evaluation of models before new models are implemented operationally. METViewer serves both the research and operational communities in this way - offering capabilities for researchers to test their own enhancements to models and providing a capability for the DTC to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of advances in NWP prior to operational implementation.

The METViewer package will also be available to DTC visitors and to the modeling community for testing and evaluation of new model capabilities, applications in new environments, and so on.
