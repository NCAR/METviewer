METviewer User's Guide
======================

**Foreword: A note to METviewer users**

This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the METviewer. METviewer is a database and display system designed to work with the ascii output statistics produced by the MET software. MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community - and especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model - to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical weather predictions.

It is important to note here that MET and METviewer are evolving software packages. Previous releases of METviewer have occurred each year since 2010. This documentation describes the 3.0 release from February 2020. Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. 

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including Tressa Fowler, John Halley Gotway, Julie Prestopnik, Lisa Goodrich, Tara Jensen, Howard Soh, Tatiana Burek, Minna Win-Gildenmeister, George McCabe.

organizations within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA): 1) Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR); 2) Next Generation
Global Predition System project (NGGPS); and 3) United State Weather
Research Program (USWRP) for their support of this work. Thanks also go
to the staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice,
and many types of support. We released METplus Alpha in February 2017
and would not have made a decade of cutting-edge verification support
without those who participated in DTC planning workshops and the NGGPS
United Forecast System Strategic Implementation Plan Working Groups
(NGGPS UFS SIP WGs).
