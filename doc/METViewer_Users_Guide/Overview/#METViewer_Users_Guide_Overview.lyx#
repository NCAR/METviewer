METViewer has been developed, and will be maintained and enhanced, by the
 Developmental Testbed Center (DTC; 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.dtcenter.org/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 The main goal of the DTC is to serve as a bridge between operations and
 research, to facilitate the activities of these two important components
 of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) community.
 The DTC provides an environment that is functionally equivalent to the
 operational environment in which the research community can test model
 enhancements; the operational community benefits from DTC testing and evaluatio
n of models before new models are implemented operationally.
 METViewer serves both the research and operational communities in this
 way - offering capabilities for researchers to test their own enhancements
 to models and providing a capability for the DTC to evaluate the strengths
 and weaknesses of advances in NWP prior to operational implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The METViewer package will also be available to DTC visitors and to the
 modeling community for testing and evaluation of new model capabilities,
 applications in new environments, and so on.

The METViewer tool reads MET verification statistics output from a database
 and creates plots using the R statistical package.
 The tool includes a web application that can be accessed from a web browser
 to create a single plot.
 The specification for each plot is built using a series of controls which
 are then serialized into XML.
 The controls are found in the left half, lower panel, and lower right quadrant
 of the METViewer browser.
 Details about these controls are found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:METViewer User Specifications"

\end_inset

.
 For each plot, METViewer generates output in the form of a SQL query, an
 R script to create the plot, a flat file containing the data that will
 be plotted and the plot itself.
 This output populates the upper right quadrant of the METViewer database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The METViewer code and documentation is maintained by the DTC in Boulder,
 Colorado.
 The MET package is freely available to the modeling, verification, and
 operational communities, including universities, governments, the private
 sector, and operational modeling and prediction centers.

\begin_layout Standard
The top menu allows the user to select a database and type for the plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first section is where the dependable variable (Y-axis) , statistic
 of interest, and series variables of interest are selected The Y2 axis
 can be used to plot a Base Rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fixed variables section controls the constraints for the plot (what
 period of data is used, what thresholds to include, interpolation method,
 as well as domains).
 Fixed values are the stratifications.
 For example, select one or more thresholds to be aggregated, or one or
 more initilization times, or a date range based on valid times or cycle
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the above selections can have one or multiple items.
 To add variables, series, or fixed values, select the button with the '+'
 directly below the desired item.
 Then additional selections will appear in a new dropdown menu.
 To delete these extras, select the trash icon to the left of the item.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The independent variable section is where the X-axis is configured.
 As an example, forecast lead hour often serves as the x-axis for a series
 plot.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Confidence intervals
\series default
 - METviewer supports two statistical derivation methods...
 (1) plot the mean of the daily stats with confidence intervals defined
 by the "standard error"...
 that uses the standard deviation to add confidence intervals and assumes
 normality (2) plot the aggregated statistics with confidence intervals
 defined by bootstrapping that aggregation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method (1) and it works well for some of the categorical stats, like BASER
 and FMEAN.
 However, applying it to GSS results in this error:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
==== Start Rscript error ==== Error in if (0 < sum(listDataInd)) { : missing
 value where TRUE/FALSE needed Execution halted ==== End Rscript error ====
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For high thresholds, GSS is undefined and causes this error message.
 When the plot is restricted to the 2 lowest thresholds, where there are
 always events, then method (1) will work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the details for applying bootstrap confidence intervals, using
 method (2) plot the aggregated statistics with confidence intervals defined
 by bootstrapping that aggregation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Statistics
\series default
" box make sure to have "
\series bold
Aggregation Statistics
\series default
" selected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Statistics
\series default
" box in the dropdown menu select the line type to be aggregated.
 For GSS, aggregate CTC lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Statistics
\series default
" box select the number of bootstrapping replicates, using in general, at
 least 1000.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that to make the plot exactly repeatable in subsequent runs, set the
 boostrapping seed to any number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Series Formatting

".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some other suggestions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing the "
\series bold
Common
\series default
" tab, setting alpha will affect the CI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the "
\series bold
Common
\series default
" tab, select "
\series bold
Y1 Stagger Points
\series default
".
 That prevents the CI bars from being plotted on top of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bootstrapping 1000 times takes longer to generate the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To really compare the difference of these lines, consider plotting their
 pairwise difference:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the bottom-left corner, select "
\series bold
+Add Derived Curve
\series default
".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the pop-up, choose GFS in the first box and FV3GFS in the second, make
 sure "
\series bold
DIFF
\series default
" is selected, and click "
\series bold
Create Derived Curve
\series default
".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This will create a new entry in the "
\series bold
Series Formatting
\series default
" table.
 Select "
\series bold
boot
\series default
" in the "
\series bold
Conf Interval
\series default
" column.
 Change the color to black and line width to 3.
 And set "
\series bold
Show Significance
\series default
" to Yes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In "
\series bold
Series Formatting
\series default
" set the "
\series bold
Legend Text
\series default
" to FV3GFS, GFS, and GFS-FV3GFS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Y1
\series default
" tab get rid of the "
\series bold
Y1 Limits
\series default
" setting so that R can fit all the data on the plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the "
\series bold
Formatting
\series default
" tab, set the "
\series bold
Plot Script Commands
\series default
" to draw a gray dashed reference line at 0: abline(h=0,col="gray",lty=2,lwd=3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This shows that at GFS has a statistically significant higher GSS score
 than FV3GFS at the lowest threshold.
 But the results are not statistically significant at higher thresholds.
 Visually, when the confidence interval for the pairwise difference line
 does not include 0, the difference is significant and METviewer plots the
 CI in bold.
 That's the effect of turning on "
\series bold
Show Significance
\series default
".

\series bold
R data
\series default
 - It is essential that all users look at the contents of this tab.
 Contained here is the data used to create the plot.
 Users should check to see if it is correct.
 Often, a user with limited knowledge of the database may select data in
 such a way as to combine information in an unintended way.
 For example, statistics for different event thresholds should not be combined,
 but if the user fails to select the threshold(s) correctly in the 'fixed
 values' section of METViewer, the plot will show statistics for the combined
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
SQL
\series default
 - This tab contains the SQL code used to gather the data for the plot.
\end_layout
