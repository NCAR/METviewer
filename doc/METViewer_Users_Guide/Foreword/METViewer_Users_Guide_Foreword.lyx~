This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the METViewer.
 METViewer is a database and display system designed to work with the ascii
 output statistics produced by the MET software.
 MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed
 Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community - and
 especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting
 (WRF) model - to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical
 weather predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
It is important to note here that MET and METVIEWer are evolving software
 packages.
 Previous releases of METViewer have occurred each year since 2010.
 This documentation describes the 2.5 release from May 2018.
 Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.
