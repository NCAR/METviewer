<p>
  If the testing is done using crontab the gituser credentials should be stored in the git store
  - see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage. Also, auto_test.sh should be
  modified to send emails with testing results.
</p>


<h3>Testing - capture</h3>
<p>The testing modual is used to execute the regression testing of a specified
  version of METviewer. The capture tool is invoked by using the mv_test script.
  During test capture, system or processing errors will be reported but images and data are not
  verified.
  Verification of data or images is performed by the mv_compare script. The mv_test script
  essentially generates output files and
  copies them from the output directory to the appropriate directory test_cases directory.
</p>
<p>
  Capture and Verification are performed against a specified METviewer branch and tag. It is
  expected that the proper branch or tag has been
  previously fetched or cloned and checked out into the METviewer home directory that is specified
  with -m (the auto test script does check out specific code
  and then runs test capture and compare - see below). The METviewer test directory should also be a
  subdirectory that corresponds to the proper branch and
  tag, with an output directory that will contain the generated images, scripts and data for a given
  test run,
  along with the corresponding test_data (use case xml files) and load data (load specification xml
  files). The actual load data files are not
  yet source controlled and so they are linked from the path to the met data that is specified with
  the -l option. The auto_test script takes branch
  and tag parameters and creates the proper test subdirectory and reconciles properly with the
  remote repository. All the mv_test script needs is the
  proper test subdirectory. Successfully generated output images will be copied to the appropriate
  test_cases directory.
</p>
<h5>NOTE ABOUT GIT TAGS</h5>
<p>
  A short discussion of METviewer git tags is appropriate here. Git tags are not directly related to
  any git branches. They are different things. A git tag simply refers to a
  specific commit to the git repository. The branches that existed at the time of the tagging could
  all be deleted (except for the master) and the tag would still
  be a valid tag. For our purposes we name tags after our branches, i.e. MV_2_6_tagname or something
  like that. This creates an mnemonic
  relationship to a branch. Furthermore we only create tags after a commit to a specific branch that
  we then reference in the tag name. That tagged commit is
  a special point in the history of the repository, a point that we wanted to capture with a name on
  behalf of a branch. Specifying the tag and branch here
  allows us to set the repository pointer to the specific commit that we wanted to capture for a
  given branch. Including a branch name is only a mnemonic that
  reminds us which branch we were setting the tag on behalf of. The mnemonic allows us to organize
  our tests for regression checking against special times in
  the repository commit history.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE that since we want to do binary comparisons on captured test data the test data is saved in a
  directory structure that
  is mnemonically tied to the product branches or tags. The METviewer code under test is only ever
  checked out to one specific branch HEAD, or to a tag point, at a time.
  Its produced data and images may be compared, however, to data that was captured by a different
  version or tag point of METviewer code.

  This test directory structure might look like this, for example...
    <pre>
        METVIEWER_TEST_DIR/
            MV_2_5/
                HEAD/

<h3>Testing - verify</h3>
<p>
  The mv_compare script accepts a branch and a tag that it uses to identify a test subdirectory and
  a second "expected" branch and
  tag that it uses to identify a comparison test directory. If tags are ommited the HEAD is used.
  The compare script looks for corresponding image files in the corresponding plots directories and
  does a binary comparison of
  the corresponding files. Differences will be reported as errors.
</p>
<h3>auto test</h3>
<p>
  The auto_test script defines the branch, optionally a tag, directories, and database credentials
  for a version under test
  and a comparison version. It performs the following steps...
<ul>
  <li>Remove any METviewer directory and METviewerTestSource directory</li>
  <li>Do a git clone into the METviewer home directory and checkout the corresponding branch or
    tag
  </li>
  <li>Do a git clone of the METviewer testing repository into the METviewerTestSource directory
    (this is not the test directory)
  </li>
  <li>If needed create a METVIEWER_TEST_DIR subdirectory for the specified branch and load common
    data from the METviewerTestSource into it
  </li>
  <li>Run the testing capture program to capture test data for the specified branch, and copy the
    data to the corresponding test subdirectory
  </li>
  <li>Run the testing verify program to verify the images in the two corresponding test
    subdirectories
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  auto_test example: ./bin/auto_test.sh -Usomegituser -t/myhomedir/METViewerTest -bmv_2_5_dev
  -Bmv_2_5_dev -l/myhomedir/METViewerTestData -dmydb -umet_admin -m/myhomedir/METViewer -pdppassword
  -hdphost -P3306
</p>
<p>
  mv_test example:
  /bin/sh ./bin/mv_test.sh -t/myhomedir/METViewerTest/mv_2_5_dev/HEAD -m/myhomedir/METViewer -dmydb
  -umet_admin -pdppassword -hdphost -P3306 -l -c
</p>
<p>
  mv_compare example:
  /bin/sh ./bin/mv_compare.sh -m /myhomedir/METViewer -t /myhomedir/METViewerTest/mv_2_5_dev/HEAD -c
  /myhomedir/METViewerTest/mv_2_5_dev/HEAD
